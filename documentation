**A description of the problem faced**
First of all, we learned what Zipf's laws are. Applied to NLP it bassically helps us to understand how terms are differently distributed in a given text. We have to find if the texts follow this power law. 


**Approach used for solving the problem.** For solving this problem we decide to use the NLTK library. It's a very mature and well known library. Build our own tools will be very instructive but though. We have to make a lot of  try and essay test to assure that the results we find are corrects. Meanwhile, we saw that after some tests, NLTK was giving ver accurate results in a very fast and optimized way.
